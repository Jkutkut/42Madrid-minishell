# TODO:

## Bugs:
- If command entered (and it is stored into the history), then an empty line is entered and the up arrow is pressed, the command is not shown.

## Now:
- Document functions.
- All [issues](https://github.com/SubliminalMessage/minishell/issues).


## Before ending project:
- Use ``ft_`` in all functions (Norm V3).
- Check protection of all mallocs.
